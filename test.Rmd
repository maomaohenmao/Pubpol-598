## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r getting data}
donor <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maomaohenmao/r_course_evans_school/master/data/small_donations_data.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r table}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
  donor %>% 
  filter(contributor_employer_name %in% c('MICROSOFT', 'THE COCA-COLA COMPANY', 'NUCOR STEEL SEATTLE, INC.', 'FARMERS INSURANCE', 'UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON')) %>% 
  group_by(contributor_employer_name) %>% 
  summarise(avg_amount = mean(amount), max_amount = max(amount))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
